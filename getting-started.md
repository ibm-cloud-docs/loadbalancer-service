# Getting started with IBM Cloud Load Balancer 
{: #getting-started}

The {{site.data.keyword.loadbalancer_full}} service helps customers improve availability of their business-critical applications by distributing traffic among multiple application server instances, and by forwarding traffic to healthy instances only. 
{: shortdesc}

To get started using {{site.data.keyword.loadbalancer_full}}, you require two main items: 

* An account with IBM - [IBMid ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/account/us-en/signup/register.html){: new_window}
* An IBM server, either [Bare Metal](/docs/bare-metal?topic=bare-metal-getting-started) or [Virtual Server Instance (VSI)](/docs/vsi)

If you need assistance in obtaining an **IBMid** account, contact your IBM Sales representative for additional guidance.
